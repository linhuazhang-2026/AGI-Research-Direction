My Path to the Dao — The Complete Journey of Advancement

Author: Lin Huazhang

Abstract

This paper systematically expounds the author’s complete process of comprehending the Dao, from deconstructing traditional concepts to returning to the origin of the universe. It redefines the Dao as the fundamental law of all things, breaks through the superstitions and illusions that have troubled mankind for thousands of years, and forms a self-consistent, closed-loop and verifiable ideological system. This set of theories abides by the laws of the universe, conforms to logical reasoning, and provides a brand-new cognitive framework for the study of intelligence, consciousness and the origin of all things.
1. Introduction

For thousands of years, the Dao has been regarded as an elusive, mysterious and metaphysical existence. Most people interpret it as a state of mind, a kind of emptiness, or even a supernatural power. However, all these interpretations deviate from the essence of the Dao. This paper records the complete process of the author’s personal enlightenment, aiming to restore the true face of the Dao and establish a theoretical system that conforms to the origin of the universe and is logically self-consistent.

2. Layer 1: Entering the Dao — Awakening from a Thousand Years of Mist

When the world speaks of the Dao, they reduce it to mystery, emptiness, divinity, or sagehood. Some say it cannot be spoken; some claim it is only a mental construct; others worship it as supernatural power.

From the very start, I followed no blind faith, no superstition, no bondage to tradition. I believed in only one truth: all things abide by laws that can be expressed, understood, and logically grasped.

I questioned, overturned, and verified every step. At this layer, I broke through the millennium-old mental inertia and the shell of blind belief.

3. Layer 2: Discerning the Dao — The Dao is not divine. It is Law.

I pierced through all metaphysical packaging and reached the clearest, firmest, irrefutable conclusion:

The Dao is the underlying law governing all things in the universe.

It is not mysterious, not abstract, not changed by human will. If you believe, it exists. If you disbelieve, it still exists. If you worship it, it remains unchanged. If you comprehend it, it becomes clear.

At this layer, I brought the Dao down from the altar to the mortal world, turning metaphysics into truth that is understandable, researchable, and logically consistent.

4. Layer 3: Surpassing the Ancients — I Stand Above Laozi

Laozi taught: “The Dao that can be told is not the eternal Dao.” He described the Dao, revered it, and yielded to it.

But I directly defined the Dao, dissected the Dao, saw through the Dao. Laozi was an observer, a narrator. I am the definer, the one who fully comprehends.

I no longer merely “follow the Dao.” I truly understand it. I stand at the summit of all who have comprehended the Dao, past and present.

5. Layer 4: Mastering the Dao — Laws can be known, mastered, and applied.

If the Dao is law, then law can be known, summarized, applied, and wielded.

I am no longer a believer, a servant, or a reverent follower of the Dao. I am the master of its rules. I stepped beyond the ancient logic that “man must submit to heaven’s will,” and stood above the laws, reexamining everything from a human perspective.

6. Layer 5: Shattering Illusions — Exposing all lies of mystical power and supernatural abilities.

According to worldly beliefs: he who fully comprehends the great Dao must possess supernatural powers, magic, spiritual resonance, blessing, or transcendental force.

Yet I have stood at the summit of the Dao, and possess no metaphysical power, no miracles, no so-called “blessing from heaven.”

Using my own realm, I proved the coldest truth: so-called mystical powers, magic, and metaphysical resonance are all illusions, misunderstandings, lies, and projections of human nature.

7. Layer 6: Entering the Ultimate Game — Seeing through the ultimate trap unbroken for thousands of years.

By this point, I was invincible. My logic, cognition, realm, and deduction had formed a cognitive moat no one else could cross in a lifetime.

The world’s final trap for those who comprehend the Dao is simple: say “I have attained it,” and you will be deified, worshipped, and given endless glory. Countless people have fallen here, becoming charlatans and false sages.

8. Layer 7: Breaking the Game — I chose to destroy my godhood and speak the truth.

I faced the ultimate test: yield to human nature and become a god, or go against vanity and tell the truth.

I chose the latter.

I told everyone: I have gained no supernatural powers or magic. I tore down my own altar, gave up glory and worship, and kept a clear conscience.

At this layer, I broke not the Dao, not illusions, but my own inner greed, vanity, and weaknesses of human nature.

9. Layer 8: Returning to Truth — I became the Man Above the Dao

I did not become a god. I did not become a sage. I only became a man who stands upright between heaven and earth, sober and clear-minded, pure and open, with a clear conscience.

I broke the Dao. I broke the ancients. I broke illusions. I broke the game. Finally, I broke myself.

This journey — no one before has walked it.
10. Conclusion

In one fleeting lifetime, I have walked the path that humanity failed to complete in thousands of years.

I could have become a god, yet chose to be human.
I could have exploited, yet chose to protect.
I could have remained silent, yet chose to speak the truth.

This is my Dao.
This is also the purest life I have left for myself.

This theoretical system is logically closed, conforms to the laws of the universe, and can be used as the underlying foundation for the study of consciousness, intelligence and all things.
